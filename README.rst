======================
NoWannaNoCry - nwnc.py
======================

A script to help mitigate against the *WCry* malware which can infect
vulnerable and exposed Windows machines over the internet.  Note: The
spreading of the initial version of this malware has been stopped by a
built-in kill switch, but new variants have appeared in the meantime.

Some script operations need elevated permissions, so don't just trust me
on this, but read this document carefully and have a look at the code
itself before running it.

**Important:** The script can only diagnose and close the security hole
which is being exploited by *WCry* to infect new machines.  To my
knowledge, so far it's not possible to recover already encrypted files
without the encryption key (which of course I don't have).  Therefore,
this script won't help you if your machine is already infected.

to be run on mission critical systems.  Also there's no

  * Has not been tested on many different systems yet, so it may not be
    robust enough to run on yours.


About WCry
----------

"WCry", "WannaCry", "WannaCrypt", "WanaCrypt0r", "Wanna" and some others
are all names for a malware/ransomware which has recently surfaced and
can spread rapidly.

In a nutshell, it can infect vulnerable Windows systems without any user
interaction.  Once infected, it will encrypt various types of files on
those systems, then prompt the user to pay ~300$ in Bitcoins for the
decryption key.

It does so by exploiting a critical Windows security hole using code
derived from the recently leaked trove of NSA hacking tools (`EternalBlue
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue>`_).  From what I've read it's
not entirely clear how it's spreading (i.e. if exploiting that security
hole is the only means of propagation).

The bad news is that the security hole it exploits doesn't require any
user interaction.  The good news is that Microsoft has patched that hole
in a recent security update (already back in March).  So if your
machines are up-to-date, they're probably not vulnerable.

About this script
-----------------

The script is actually nothing special, just runs a bunch of commands
which I gathered from the previously mentioned links (all credit goes to
the respective parties).  It's written in Python [1]_, which has to be
installed on your computer (see `Python`_ below).

The script accepts the following parameters:

  * ``-c`` or ``--check``: Check if the system is vulnerable.
    
  * ``-m`` or ``--mitigate``: Disable the SMB v1 protocol if no fix is
    already installed.

  * ``-f`` or ``--fix``: Tries to automatically determine, download and
    install a Microsoft KB update for your version of Windows.


Usage
-----

Download the file *nwnc.py* from the *src* folder and open a command
prompt (e.g. press Windows key + R, then type: ``cmd``)::

    \> cd path\to\directory\containing\the\script
  
If you only want to see if your system is vulnerable::

    \> python nwnc.py -c

If you want to disable the SMB v1 protocol [2]_ in case your system is
vulnerable (``-m`` implies ``-c``)::

    \> python nwnc.py -m
    
To download and install an appropriate KB update in case your system is
vulnerable (``-f`` also implies ``-c``)::

    \> python nwnc.py -f
    
Optionally, you can specify a download directory manually (if you don't,
a temporary directory is automatically created).  For example::

    \> python nwnc.py -f --download-directory "C:\Users\MyName\Downloads"


Python
------

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is a scripting language available for
all major platforms and needs to be installed on your system to run this
script.

If you don't want to do that, I recommend you have a look at the reddit
thread to which I linked in `About WCry`_ for manual instructions.


Manual Approaches
-----------------

  - The simplest way to fix the security hole is to enable automatic
    Windows Updates and let it install the latest patches.

  - Microsoft has released KB updates even for systems that are no longer
    supported, i.e. Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows 8 (see
    the Ars Technica article in `Additional Links`_).  Links to these
    updates are included in *nwnc.py*, therefore you could just open the
    script with a text editor, search for ``KB_DOWNLOAD`` and copy the
    correct download URL for your own system.

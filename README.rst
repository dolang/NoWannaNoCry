======================
NoWannaNoCry - nwnc.py
======================

A script to help mitigate against the WCry malware which was spreading
over the internet. The spreading of the initial version of this malware
seems to have been stopped by a built-in kill switch.

Some script operations need elevated permissions, so don't just trust me
on this, but read this document carefully and have a look at the code
itself before running it.

**Important:** The script can only diagnose and close the security hole
 which is being exploited by WCry to infect new machines.  It is
 impossible to recover already encrypted files without the encryption key
 (which I obviously don't have).  Therefore, this script won't help you
 if your machine is already infected.


Disclaimer / WIP
----------------

**This is a work in progress and as such is probably not suitable to be
run on mission critical systems.  Also there's no guarantee/warranty of
any kind, as pointed out in the LICENSE.**


Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Doesn't properly request admin privileges when run under Python 2.
    I.e. you need to open an admin console beforehand, then run the 
    script from there.

  * The ``fix`` command hasn't been implemented yet.

  * Has not been tested on many different systems yet, so it's probably
    not robust enough to run on yours.


About WCry
----------

"WCry", "WannaCry", "WannaCrypt", "WanaCrypt0r", "Wanna" and some others
are all names for a malware/ransomware which has recently surfaced and
can spread rapidly.  In a nutshell, it can infect Windows systems through
a security hole. Then it will encrypt various types of files on those
systems and wants you to pay ~300$ in Bitcoins for the decryption key.

It does so by exploiting a critical Windows security hole using code
derived from the recently leaked trove of NSA hacking tools (`EternalBlue
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue>`_).  From what I've read it's
not entirely clear how it's spreading.  But the bad news is that the
security hole it exploits at least inside a local network doesn't require
any user interaction.  The good news is that Microsoft has patched that
hole in a recent security update.  So if your machines are up-to-date,
they're probably not vulnerable.

About this script
-----------------

It's actually nothing special, just runs a bunch of commands which I
gathered from the previously mentioned links. Then I put them into a
command line script written in Python [1]_.  All credit goes to the
respective parties.

The script has the following parameters:

  * ``-c`` or ``--check``: Check if the system is vulnerable.
    
  * ``-m`` or ``--mitigate``: Disable the SMB v1 protocol if no fix is already
    installed.

  * Soon to come, not yet done: ``-f`` or ``--fix``: ...


Usage
-----

Download the file ``nwnc.py`` from the ``src`` folder, open a command prompt
and then...

If you only want to see if your system is vulnerable::

    \> cd path\to\directory\containing\the\script
    \> python nwnc.py -c

If you want to disable the SMB v1 protocol [2]_ if your system is vulnerable::

    \> cd path\to\directory\containing\the\script
    \> python nwnc.py -m


Python
------

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is a scripting language available for
all major platforms and needs to be installed on your system to run this
script.

If you don't want to do that, I recommend to instead having a look at the
reddit thread to which I linked in `About WCry`_.
